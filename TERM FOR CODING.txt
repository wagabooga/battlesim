TERMINOLOGY FOR CODING

FUNCTION:
	input -> output system
PARAMETERS:
	one of the inputs to functions ( can have multiple parameters to a function )
VARIABLES:
	is a name that we assigned to a computer memory (IN RAM, which is part of a running program) location
SCOPE:
	the area (in a program) where a variable is visible 
DATA TYPE:
	the category of which data is classified
ABSTRACT DATA TYPE:
    a new data type defined by us that includes other data types or methods (example Player class or Item class)
FUNCTION/METHOD CALL:
	when you have a function and you use it/the usage of a function or method
CONDITION:
	a boolean value
KEYWORDS:
    Specific words that contains built in functionality (while, else, if, class, True, False), can not be used for anything other than their purpose.
COMPARISON:
	combining two variables and an operator to check for conditions
OPERATORS:
	(+, -, =, /, <, >, *,not/!,==,and,or,=!,>=,<=,**(^),%) a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.
INTERPRETER:
	a program that runs specific types of code (one line at a time)
IDE (Integrated development environment):
    A combination of a text editor, and an environment in which you can run code
COMPILER:
	a program that builds code into an executable file
SOURCE CODE:
	human written code that needs an interpreter or compiler to run
MACHINE CODE:
	code that's not human-readable that the computer understands how to run( not written by humans )
LOOP:
CONTROL FLOW:
INDEX:
    a numerical representation of a position at which an item is located in a sequence
    Values:              1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    Indexes or Indices:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
TO INDEX:
    to look up a value in a data structure based on a given parameter (this depends on the data structure), if its a list it will be an index(number), if its a dictionary, it will be a key(depends on dictionary).

OBJECT ORIENTED TERMINOLOGY:
-----------------------------

CLASS:
	a block of code that holds a bunch of stuff in a scope ( a blueprint, a factory; a base building block where you can put data and functions inside)
OBJECT(INSTANCE):
	a variable that instantiates(creates a copy of) a class
MEMBER VARIABLE:
	a variable in association with a class
MEMBER FUNCTION(METHOD):
	a function in association in a class
